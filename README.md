# Surprise Housing Regression Assignment
# Problem Statement
Surprise Housing Company, a US-based entity, aims to leverage data analytics to purchase houses below their actual values and resell them for profit. The objective is to develop a regression model using regularisation techniques to predict the actual value of prospective properties based on a dataset containing sale details of houses in Australia. The company seeks to identify significant variables influencing house prices and assess how well those variables describe house prices.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Built and evaluated Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso models.
- Ridge model outperformed others, offering simplicity and optimization.
- Important predictors:
 - Neighborhood
 - Square footage of ground floor, 1st floor, and 2nd floor.
 - Basement build quality, foundation, exterior, overall quality, and house style.
 - Garage size.
